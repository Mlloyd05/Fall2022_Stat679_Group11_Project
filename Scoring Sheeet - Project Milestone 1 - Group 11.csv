Motivation and Goals,"(9) The report demonstrates that its authors have immersed themselves in the problem context and have thoughtfully considered their visualization goals.
(7) Describes motivation and goals in terms of broader problem context but is at times underdeveloped.
(5) Includes some discussion of problem context but the discussion of goals is at times unclear and incomplete.
(3) Places too much emphasis on technical elements and does not clearly articulate purpose within broader context.",8,"The goals are interesting, and it is clear that you have invested effort into understanding this problem. I have some concerns about the scope, though. Even a few isolated parts of the proposal (metrics for peak performance, integrating across data sources) already seem very challenging. I believe that you will be able to compare many approaches, but how will you assess whether a change improves or worsens the utility across all the audiences you have identified? I recommend prototyping your design using a subset of players / sports / positions that you are most familiar with. If you like your approach there, then you can generalize to the rest of the data."
